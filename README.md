A list of cool software for genetic analysis and the like.

*currenty in no particluar order. Please contribute.You can add to it, reorganise it..but don't delete it*

- **Plink2** [https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/)  

- **bgenie** [https://jmarchini.org/bgenie](https://jmarchini.org/bgenie/): A program for efficient GWAS for multiple continuous traits and PHEWAS with many features designed and optimized for large scale analysis.  

- **PRSice** [https://github.com/choishingwan/PRSice](https://github.com/choishingwan/PRSice): PRSice (pronounced 'precise') is a software package for calculating, applying, evaluating and plotting the results of polygenic risk scores (PRS). PRSice can run at high-resolution to provide the best-fit PRS as well as provide results calculated at broad P-value thresholds, illustrating results corresponding to either, can thin SNPs according to linkage disequilibrium and P-value ("clumping"), and can be applied across multiple traits in a single run.

- **GCTA** [http://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/](http://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/): GCTA (Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis) was originally designed to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genome- or chromosome-wide SNPs for complex traits (the GREML method), and has subsequently extended for many other analyses to better understand the genetic architecture of complex traits

- **FlashPCA2** [https://github.com/gabraham/flashpca](https://github.com/gabraham/flashpca) FlashPCA performs fast principal component analysis (PCA) of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, similar to smartpca from EIGENSOFT (http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/alkes-price/software/) and shellfish (https://github.com/dandavison/shellfish). FlashPCA is based on the https://github.com/yixuan/spectra/ library.
